      <strong> The back-to-back killings in Rogers Park seemed to be as random as they were brutal:</strong> an elderly man walking his dogs just steps from his home on Sunday and then, barely 36 hours later, a young man walking blocks away on the Lakefront Trail near Loyola Park. Both were shot once in the head, left for dead.
    </p>

    <p>
      But police on Tuesday confirmed what for many residents was their worst fear: <strong>The same gun was used to shoot both men, most likely by the same gunman.</strong> Just about every other detail <strong>remains a mystery.</strong>  Mayor Rahm Emanuel  urged residents to use caution as they go about their daily lives.

    </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>  “To all the residents of the Rogers Park community, your city is standing with you, supporting you, at this moment,” Emanuel said at a news conference. "I know firsthand the Rogers Park community is strong, is resilient and is a supportive community. We need those core values and the Police Department needs those core values at this time.” </p></blockquote>

  <p>  Chicago police released an image of the suspect in the fatal shooting of a 73-year-old man in Rogers Park on Sept. 30, 2018. Police have determined the same gun was used in the killing of a 24-year-old man, just blocks away, on the lakefront path by Loyola Park on Oct. 1. (Chicago Police Department)</p>

      Grace Hussar, 34, said she continues to feel safe in her neighborhood and encouraged people to remain out and about despite the recent violence. She organized an event Tuesday at Loyola Park for neighbors to come together, meet one another and talk about the shootings.
